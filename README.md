# Hey, I'm Batuhan Karakuş

I'm a Computer Engineering student who spends a bit too much time staring at terminals and asking,  
"Why is this working?" (instead of the usual “Why isn't it working?”).

I'm into systems programming, AI, compilers, and all the beautiful chaos in between.  
Sometimes I build things, sometimes I break things—mostly I learn from both.

## Who am I really?

- I like writing code that’s as clean as my desk *should* be.
- I believe "It works" is just the beginning, not the end.
- I enjoy solving problems no one asked me to solve.
- I read research papers, and yes—I pretend to understand all of them.
- I think low-level programming is underrated and coffee is overused. (Still drinking though.)
